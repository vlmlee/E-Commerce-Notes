## Chapter 1

Search engines have two major functions: crawling and building an index. Over the years, engineers have devised better ways to map results to searcher’s queries. Hundreds of factors influence relevance today. Search engines typically assume that the more popular a site, the more valuable the information it contains.  The algorithms used by search engines comprise of hundreds of variables. They are referred to as ranking factors. 

__Google recommends the following to get better rankings in their search engines:__

1. Make pages for users, not search engines.
2. Don’t deceive your users or present different content to search engines than you display to users. This practice is called cloaking.
3. Make a site with a clear hierarchy and text links. Every page should be reachable from at least one static text link.
4. Create a useful, information rich site, and write pages that clearly and accurately describes your content. 
5. Make sure your title elements and alt attributes are descriptive and accurate.
6. Use keywords to create descriptive, human-friendly URLs.
7. Provide one version of a URL to reach a document, using 301 redirects or the rel=“canonical” attribute to address duplicate content.

### Search Engine Experiment

1. Register a new website with nonsense keywords. (www.asdasdf.com)
2. Create multiple pages on that website, all targeting a ludicrous term. (asdfwer)
3. Make the pages as close to identical as possible, then alter one variable at a time, experimenting with placement of text, formatting, use of keywords, link structures, etc.
4. Point links at the domain from indexed, well-crawled pages on other domains.
5. Record the rankings of the pages in search engines.
6. Now make small alterations to the pages and assess their impact on search results to determine what factors might push a result up or down against its peers.
7. Record any results that appear to be effective, and retest them on other domains or with other terms. 

## Chapter 2

The search engine’s primary responsibility is to serve relevant results to their users. Ask yourself what your target customers are looking for and make sure your site delivers it to them.

### Some Statistics

1. Google sends 90.62% of traffic.
2. The #1 position on Google’s search result receives 18.2% of all click-through traffic. The second receives 10.1%, the third 7.2%, the fourth 4.8%, and the all the rest under 2%.
3. Online marketing approached $77 Billion in 2016.

Search drives an incredible amount of online and offline economic activity. Higher rankings are critical to visibility. Being listed in the top instills trust in consumers as to the worthiness and relative importance of the company or website.

## Chapter 3

An important aspect of SEO is making your website easy for both users and search engine web crawlers to understand. Understanding the abilities and limitations of search engines allows you to properly build, format, and annotate your web content in a way search engines can digest. Without SEO, a website may be invisible to search engines.

### Problems Crawling and Indexing

1. Online forms: search engines aren’t good at completing online forms, such as login and thus any content contained behind them may be hidden.
2. Duplicate pages: websites using a CMS often creates duplicate versions of the same page; this is a major problem for search engines looking for completely original content.
3. Blocked in the code: errors in a website’s crawling directives (robots.txt) may lead to blocking search engines. 
4. Poor link structure: if a website’s link structure isn’t understandable to the search engines, they may not reach all of a website’s content or if it is crawled, the minimally exposed content may be deemed unimportant. 
5. Non-text content: although the engines are getting better reading non-HTML text, content in rich media format is still difficult for search engines to parse. 

### Problems Matching Queries to Content

1. Uncommon terms: text that is not written in the common terms that people use to search.
2. Language and internationalization subtleties: for example, “color” vs colour”. 
3. Incongruous location targeting: targeting content in polish when the majority of people visiting are Japanese.
4. Mixed contextual signals: the title of your blog is “Mexico’s Best Coffee” but the post is about a vacation resort in Canada that happens to serve great coffee.

Even though getting search friendly content is important, you must also market your content. You will have to get that content shared and talked about in order to improve its relevance and importance.

__In 2011, social media marketing and vertical search inclusion became mainstream methods for conducting search engine optimization.__

Websites compete for attention and placement in the search engines, and those with the knowledge and experience to improve their website’s ranking will receive the benefits of increased traffic and visibility.
