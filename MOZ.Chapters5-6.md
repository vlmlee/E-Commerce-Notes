Keyword research is one the most important, valuable, and high return activities in the search marketing field. Ranking for the right keyword can make your break your website. 

By researching your market’s keyword remain, you not only learn which terms and phrases to target with SEO, but also learn more about your customers as a whole.

It’s not always about getting visitors to your site but about getting the right kinds of visitors. The usefulness of this intelligence cannot be overstated: with keyword research you can predict shifts in demand, respond to changing market conditions, and produce the products, services, and content that web searchers are actively seeking.

## A basic process for evaluating a keyword’s value

1. Ask yourself: is the keyword relevant to the website’s content? Will searchers find what they are looking for on your website when they search using these keywords? Will they be happy? Will this traffic convert? 

2. Search for the term/phrase in the major engines: understanding which websites already rank for your keyword gives you insight into the competition and how they work to get ranked. Typically, search ads means a high-valued keyword, and multiple search ads above an organic result often means conversion-prone keyword.

3. Buy a sample campaign for the keyword at Google Adwords and Bing: if your website doesn’t rank for the keyword, you can buy test traffic to see how well it converts. In Adwords, point the traffic to the relevant page on your website. Track impressions and conversion rate over the course of at least 200-300 clicks.

4. Using the data you’ve collected, determine the exact value of each keyword: assume your search ad generated 5,000 impressions in one day, which 100 visitors have come to your site, and three have converted for a total profit of $300. In this case, a single visitor for that keyword is worth $3 to your business. Those 5,000 impressions in 24 hours could generate a click through of between 18-36% with a #1 ranking, which would mean 900-1800 visits per day. At $3 each, it would mean between 1-2 million dollars a year.

### Understanding the long tail of keyword demand

Although popular keywords may have lots of searches a day, they make up less than 30% or the searches performed on the web. The remaining 70% lie on the “long tail” of search. The long tail contains hundreds of millions of unique searches that might be conducted a few times in any given day, but taken together, comprises the majority of the world’s search volume.

A lesson search marketers have learn is that long tail keywords often covert better because they catch people later in the buying/conversion cycle. A person searching for “shoes” is probably browsing, while the person searching for “Air Jordan size 12” is already looking to buy.

Understanding the search demand curve is critical. Ignore the long tail at your peril - search marketing and web site content strategies must allow for this “impossible to predict” form of visits or risk losing out to a more expository and prolific competitor.

The search engines constantly strive to improve their performance by providing the best possible results. While best is subjective, the engines have a very good idea of the kinds of pages and sites that satisfy their searchers. Generally, these sites have several traits in common:

1. Easy to use, navigate, and understand
2. Provide direct, actionable information relevant to the query
3. Professionally designed and accessible to modern browsers
4. Deliver high quality, legitimate, credible information

Search engines rely on meta information about how people interact with sites and pages, and this gives them insight to the quality of the pages themselves. 

### The impact of usability and user experience

On search engine rankings: there are limited number of variables that search engines take into account directly, including keywords, links, site structure. Through linking patterns, user engagement metrics, and machine learning, the engines make a considerable number of intuitions about a given site.

Usability and user experience are second order influences on search engine ranking successes. They provide an indirect but measurable benefit to a site’s external popularity, which the engines can then interpret as a signal of higher quality. This is called the “no one likes to link to a crummy site” phenomenon. 

Crafting a thoughtful, empathetic user experience helps ensure that visitors to your site perceive it positively, encouraging sharing, bookmarking, return visits, and inbound links - all signals that trickle down to the search engines and contribute to high rankings. 

### Signals of Quality Content

1. Engagement metrics: when a search engine delivers a page of results to you, it can measure the success of the rankings by observing how you engage with those results. If you click the first link but immediately went back to the search page to try the second link, it means you were not satisfied with the first result. Search engines seek the “long click” where users click a result without immediately returning to the search page. 

2. Machine Learning: Google incorporated machine learning to mimic human evaluators of websites.

3. Linking Patterns: link structure of the web could server as a proxy for votes and popularity. Higher quality sites and information earned more links than their less useful, lower quality peers. 

All of that positive attention and excitement around the content offered by the new site translate into a machine-parseable collection of links. The timing, source, anchor text, and number links to the new site are  factored into its potential performance for relevant queries at the engines. 

### Crafting Content

Appealing, useful content is crucial to search engine optimization. Every search performed at the engines comes with an intent - to find, learn, solve, buy, fix, treat, or understand. Search engines place web pages in their results in order to satisfy that intent in the best possible way. 

### Search Intent Flavors

1. Transactional searches: identifying a local business, making a purchase online, or completing a task. Don’t necessary involve a credit card or wire transfer. 

2. Navigational searches: visiting a pre-determined destination or sourcing a specific url. The intent is surfing directly to a specific website. 

3. Informational searches: researching non-transactional information, getting quick answers, or ego-searching. The information itself is the goal.

Fulfilling these intents is up to you. Creative, high quality writing, use of examples, images, and multimedia can all help in crafting content that matches the searcher’s goals.
