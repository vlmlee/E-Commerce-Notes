Professional SEOs track data about rankings, referrals, links, and more to help analyze their SEO strategy. 

## Recommended metrics to track

Knowing the percentages and numbers will help identify weaknesses to your strategy and give you a basis for comparison. 

1. Search Engine Share of Referring Visits: keep track of the contributions of each traffic source for your site. These include: Direct navigation, bookmarks, email links without tracking codes, etc; referral traffic from links across the web; search traffic from any major or minor web search engine.

2. Search Engine Referrals: three major engines make up 95% of all search traffic. Measuring the contributions of your search traffic gives you comparison of performance vs market share, get visibility into potential drops, and uncover strategic value. 

3. Visits referred to by specific search engine terms and phrases: keywords that send traffic are an important piece of your analytics pie. Find terms that are bringing in significant traffic and optimize for them.

4. Conversion rate by search query term/phrase: few metrics matters as much as conversion. Figure out which keyword converts, check your rankings for that keyword, improve that position, and improve the UX on the page the keyword points to.

5. Number of pages receiving at least one visit from search engines: the number of pages that find their way to the search results is essential.

## Applying that Data

Fluctuations can happen but can be signs of loss of indexation due to penalties, hacking, or malware. You should do a thorough analysis with web analytics tools.

Falling web traffic probably means youâ€™ve done something on your site to block crawlers or stop indexation. This could be a DNS resolution issue, something in robots.txt, or a number of other technical breakdowns. Carefully review your website with sys admins, developers, and hosting provider.

Positive ranking growth is not instant. New sites, pages, and content will have heavy competition and take time to climb up the ranks.
